### The Cat and the Mice

A house was full of mice.

A cat went into the house and began to catch and eat them one by one.

The mice then hid away (躲藏) in their holes. 

The cat couldn't catch them anymore, so she tought of a way to get them to come out.

To do this she pretended to be dead.

When the mice came near, she jumped up and caught many of them.

Pleased with the success of this, she tried another plan.

She covered herself with flour(面粉) and lay on some flour bags, as if she were one of them.

The young mice got close to her, but an old mouse said,

> "I have seen many bags in my day, but never one with a cat's head. Even if you turn into a real flour bag, 
I will not come near you."


MORAL: Don't be tricked twice by the same person.

### The Cat-Maiden(少女）

The gods were once arguing whether it was possible for a living thing to change its nature.

> Zeus said, "Yes," but Aphrodite said, "No."

So, to test this, Zeus turned a cat into a girl, and gave here to a young man for a wife.

The Wedding happened and the young couple sat down to the wedding meal.

> "See," said Zeus, to Aphrodite, "how well she behaves. Who could tell that yesterday she was a cat? Surely her nature is changed?"

>"Wait a minute," replied Aphrodite, and let a mouse loose(释放) into the room.

When the bride saw this, she jumped up and tried to catch the mouse.

>" Ah, you see," said Aphrodite, "true nature will come out."

MORAL: Try as you may, it is impossible to deny your nature.
