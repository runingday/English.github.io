### The Cat and the Mice

A house was full of mice.

A cat went into the house and began to catch and eat them one by one.

The mice then hid away (躲藏) in their holes. 

The cat couldn't catch them anymore, so she tought of a way to get them to come out.

To do this she pretended to be dead.

When the mice came near, she jumped up and caught many of them.

Pleased with the success of this, she tried another plan.

She covered herself with flour(面粉) and lay on some flour bags, as if she were one of them.

The young mice got close to her, but an old mouse said,

> "I have seen many bags in my day, but never one with a cat's head. Even if you turn into a real flour bag, 
I will not come near you."


MORAL: Don't be tricked twice by the same person.

### The Cat-Maiden(少女）

The gods were once arguing whether it was possible for a living thing to change its nature.

> Zeus said, "Yes," but Aphrodite said, "No."

So, to test this, Zeus turned a cat into a girl, and gave here to a young man for a wife.

The Wedding happened and the young couple sat down to the wedding meal.

> "See," said Zeus, to Aphrodite, "how well she behaves. Who could tell that yesterday she was a cat? Surely her nature is changed?"

>"Wait a minute," replied Aphrodite, and let a mouse loose(释放) into the room.

When the bride saw this, she jumped up and tried to catch the mouse.

>" Ah, you see," said Aphrodite, "true nature will come out."

MORAL: Try as you may, it is impossible to deny your nature.


### The Cows and the Butchers (屠夫)

The cows once decided to kill the butchers, whose job was to kill them.

They got together one day, and prepared to fight.

> One of the oldest then said, "It is true that these butchers kill us, but they do that with skillful hands, and give us little pain. If we kill them all, we'll suffer more under unskillfull(不熟练的)hands. You can be sure that even if all the butchers die, men will still want beef."

MORAL: Better the evil you know that the one you don't know.

### The Crab(螃蟹) and Its Mother

> A crab said to her son, "Why do you walk sideways(侧着), my child? It is much better to walk straight forward."

> The young crab replied, "True, dear mother. If you will show me how to do it, I will try to do that too."

The mother tried to walk straight, but couldn't do it.

MORAL: It's better to teach than simply to tell.


### The Crow (乌鸦) and the Water Bottle

A very thirsty crow saw a water bottle and flew to it, hoping to find water inside.

He realized that there was too little water for him to reach to drink.

He tried everything he could to reach the water, but failed.

At last, he collect as many stones as he could carry, and dropped them one by one into the bottle, until the water level was high enough for him to drink. 

MORAL: Necessity(需求,必需品) is the mother of invention. (创造，发明)

 ### 语法小窍门儿
 1. mice 和 mouse到底啥关系
 复数名词，往往是规则变化，在单数基础上加s/es.

 但名词复数，也存在少数不规则变化。 本文看到的mice就是复数名词，mice(老鼠们)对应的单数名词是mouse（一只老鼠)

 单复数不规则变化的名词还有:
  女人woman -- women         男人 man -- men
  孩子child -- children      人   person -- people
  牙齿 tooth -- teeth        脚  foot -- feet

  2. try as you man 语序有错么
 【本文例句】
 Try as you may, it is impossible to deny your nature.
 虽然你可以努力尝试（改变），但都无法违背自己的本性 /江山易改，本性难移。/
 
 try as you may 是一个倒装结构，中文意思为”虽然你可以努力（去改变）“。
 
 倒装的语序 try as you may
 不倒装语序 although you may try
 
 大家发现倒装时的as变成了正常语序中的although, 因为as只有在倒装的句子里才表”虽然“。 如果以后再看到as所在的句子出现倒装，请考虑as表”虽然“这个意思。 
 
 识别方式：
 看到单词被提到句首放as前 -> as表”虽然“的倒装句式
 
 【点睛例句】
 Poor as he is, he is quite happy. 
 虽然他没钱， 但很快乐。
