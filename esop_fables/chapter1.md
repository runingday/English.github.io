### Aesop and the Wrestler(摔跤手）
Aesop was talking to the winner of a Greek wrestling competition.


>"Congratulations on your win!" he said.

>"Tell me, were you smaller and weaker than your opponent(对手)?"

>"What do you mean?" said the wrestler, angrily.

>"I am the biggest and strongest wrestler in the whole of Greece!"

>"In that case, I don't think you deserve much praise after all," said Aesop

>"It is easy to win when you are bigger and stronger.

>"If your opponent had been bigger and stronger than you, and you had still won, then I would really have been impressed."

MORAL: Don't be proud of your natural abilities: be proud of what you do with them.

### Androcles and the Lion

A Slave named Androcles once escaped from his master and ran away to the forest.

As he was walking about there, he saw a lion lying down, crying in pain.

At first he turned to run, but finding that the lion did not chase him,

he turned back and went up to him.

As he came near, the lion put out his paw, which was all swollen and bleeding.

Androcles saw that a huge thorn(棘刺）and wrapped(包扎）up the paw of the lion, who was soon able to rise and lick

the hand of Androcles like a dog.

Then the lion took Androcles to his cave, and brought him meta to eat every day.

A little while afterwards both Androcles and the lion were caught, and the slave was sentenced to be thrown to the lion, 

after the lion had been kept without food for several days.

The Emperor and all his Court came to see the show, and Androcles was led out into the middle of the arena(竞技场）.

Soon the lion was let loose, and rushed jumping and roaring(咆哮）towards his victim.

But as soon as he came near to Androcles he recognized his friend, came gently up to him, and licked his hands like a friendly

dog.  The Emperor, surprised at this, asked Androcles if he knew why the lion behaved this way, and Androcles told him the 

whole story. 

Then the slave Androcles was freed, and the lion was also set free again in the forest. 

MORAL: Bravery in taking care of others is often well rewarded.

### The Ant and the Caterpillar(毛虫）

An ant running about in the sunshine looking for food met a caterpillar that was almost at its time of change, and had 

already wrapped a hard shell about itself.

The ant only noticed that the caterpillar was even alive because of a tiny movement of its tail.

>"Oh, what a unhappy animal you are!" said the ant.

>"I can climb up to the top of the tallest tree, but you can hardly even move!"

The caterpillar heard all this, but did not reply.

A few days later, when the ant passed by again, only the shell was left.

As he wondered what had happened, he felt himself in the shade.

He looked up and felt himself fanned by the wings of a beautiful butterfly.

>"Look at me now," said the butterfly,

>" the one you felt so sorry for! 

>"Tell me now what a good runner and climber you are - if you can keep up with me!"

Then the butterfly flew up into the air, carried high and far on the summer winds, 

and was never seen by the ant again.

MORAL: Do not judge by appearances.
