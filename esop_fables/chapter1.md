### Aesop and the Wrestler(摔跤手）
Aesop was talking to the winner of a Greek wrestling competition.


>"Congratulations on your win!" he said.

>"Tell me, were you smaller and weaker than your opponent(对手)?"

>"What do you mean?" said the wrestler, angrily.

>"I am the biggest and strongest wrestler in the whole of Greece!"

>"In that case, I don't think you deserve much praise after all," said Aesop

>"It is easy to win when you are bigger and stronger.

>"If your opponent had been bigger and stronger than you, and you had still won, then I would really have been impressed."

MORAL: Don't be proud of your natural abilities: be proud of what you do with them.
