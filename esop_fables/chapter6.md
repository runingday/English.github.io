### The Dancing Monkeys

A king had some monkeys trained to dance. 

Since they were already used to copying men's actions, they learned very quickly, and when dressed in their rich clothes and masks,

they danced as well as anyone in the king's palace.

They danced for many nights and everybody loved their dance. 

Then someone, for a joke, took from his pocket a handful of (少量的) nuts and threw them upon the stage. 

At the sight of the nuts, the monkeys forgot their dancing and became(as indeed they were) monkeys instead of actors. 

Pulling off (取下) their masks and tearing off (撕下) their clothes, they fought with one another for the nuts.

The show thus came to an end（结束), with the audience laughing loudly at （嘲笑) the monkeys.

MORAL: You can't hide your true nature forever. 

### The Deer and the Vine（藤蔓)

A deer, being chased by hunters, hid himself behind the large leaves of a vine. 

The hunters passed by without noticing him. 

Thinking that the danger had passed, the deer began to eat the leaves of the vine.

One of the hunters heard this and looked back. 

He saw the deer and then shot him. 

The deer, close to death, said,

> "I deserve this. I shouldn't have treated the vine that saved me this way."

MORAL: The ungrateful will not be helped a second time.

### The Dog and the rabbit.

A dog was chasing a rabbit, sometimes biting her with his teeth as if he would eat her, and other times playing with her as if 

with another dog.

> The rabbit said to him, "What do you want with me? If you are a friend, why do you bite me so hard? If you are an enemy, why do you play with me?“

MORAL: Those whom you can't always trust are not your friends.

### The Dog and the Shadow.

A dog was crossing a river bridge with some meat in his mouth.

Suddenly, he saw his ows shadow in the water, and thought is was another dog with a bigger piece of meat.

He dropped his piece of meat and attacked the other dog, to try and get the bigger piece from him. 

So he lost his piece of meat, which dropped into the river and floated away（漂走). 

MORAL: It is not wise to be too greedy(贪婪的).


### The Dog in the Hay（干草堆)

A barking dog was lying on the hay that the farmer had put down for the cows.

The cows could not eat the hay because the were scared of the dog.

> "What a selfish dog!" said one of them.

> "He can't eat the hay himself, but he won't allow us to eat it either."

MORAL: We should not prevent others from enjoying what we can't enjoy ourselves.

### The Dog, the Rooster, and the Fox

A dog and a rooster became great friends, and agreed to travel together. 

At sunset（日落), the rooster flew up into a tree to sleep, while the dog lay down in a hole in the tree. 

The next morning, the rooster woke up, and as usual, started to crown.

A fox heard this, wishing to make breakfast of him, came and stood under the tree and told him to came down.

> "I would like," he said, "to make friends with someone who has such a beautiful voice."

> The rooster replied, "Would you just wake up my friend who is sleeping at the bottom of the tree? He'll open the door and let you in."

The fox knocked on the tree, and the dog came out and tore him apart(扯开).

MORAL: He who lays traps for others is often caught by them himself. 


### 语法小窍门儿
1. shouldn't have done 悔不当初啊
【本文例句】
* I souldn't have treated the vine that saved me this way. 
我当时真不该这样对待曾经救过我命的藤蔓。 (treat the vine this way 指把藤蔓啃来吃了)

【亮点】
I shouldn't have done我们从两个角度来理解；

1）意思:当时不应该做某事（实际情况是当时却做了)
2)情绪: 我后悔啊，悔啊、肠子都悔青了

【举一反三】
在shouldn't后加have done这个完成式，表示【不应该但已经完成了]中文理解为"当时不应该做某事"
那么souldn't do 在shouldn't后加do,表示"[现在或将来]不应该做某事".时间上来看，这件事【尚未做或尚未做完].

【点睛例句】
* I was quite disappointed. I shouln't have asked him out. 我很失望，我当时就不该约他出来
* You shoudn't drink and drive. 你不应该酒后驾车.

2. When dressed这里句子缺东西么
【本文例句】
* When dressed in their rich clothes and masks, they danced as well as anyone in the king's palace. 
当穿上华服和面具后，他们同国王宫殿里的所有人跳得一样好。
【亮点】
当发现表时间的连词后【没有紧跟主语】，马上考虑:
1) 所缺的主语，就是这句话中的主句的主语
2) 出现的done,说明与主句是被动；出现doing,与主语是主动关系
3) 这是简洁的表达方式。

所以，本文例子补全后为when they were dressed in...
【点睛例句】
* Love will fly when held too lightly. 握太轻，爱会飞掉。
* Love will die when held too tightly. 握太紧，爱会死掉.
