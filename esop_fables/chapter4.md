 #### 语法小窍门儿

2. [sheep]到底是一只羊还是许多羊呢？
英语中有一类名词，单复同形，即名词的单数形式和复数形式一模一样。 
a sheep. 
three sheep.
单复同形的名词还有: fish（鱼)、deer(鹿)/Chinese. 

3. Do助攻“我真的爱你”
【本文例句】
A wolf did come at last. 最后狼真的来了。 

do 可以放在动词前，强调此动词。比如:
* do come early一定要早到哦
* do be careful. 千万要小心

使用do做强调时，需注意变位:
1.)强调过去动作，用 did + 动词原形
* I did warn you. 我可是警告过你的。

2.) 强调现在动作，用[do/does+动词原形]，选择do或does取决于主语是单数还是复数。
* I do understand. 我确实懂了.
* The dress does look nice. 裙子真的是好看. 

那么，想要强调“我是真的爱你”，我们可以说: I do love you. （do稍微重读拖长发音一些哦~)
