### The Boy and the Wolf
> A boy watching some sheep near a village called out the villagers three or four times, "Wolf! Wolf!"

When his neighbors came to help him, he laughed at them.

A wolf, however, did come at last.

The boy, now really afraid, shouted

> Please come and help me, the wolf is killing the sheep."

But no one paid any attention to his cries.

MORAL: A liar will not be believed even when telling the truth.

### The Boy Who Went Swimming

A boy was swimming in a river and went so far out that he was in danger of drowning (淹死）。

He saw a man walking by and shouted loudly for the man to save him.

But instead of saving him, the man began to tell the boy how stupid he was to swim in deep water.

> Finally, the boy shouted, "Please save me now, and save the teaching for later!"

MORAL: Help is more useful than advice.

### The Boys and the Frogs

Some boys, playing near a pond, saw a number of frogs in the water, and began to throw stones at them.

They killed serveral of them, when one of the frogs, lifting his head out of the water, cried out,

> Please stop, my boys. What is sport to you is death to us."

MORAL: What we do for fun often makes great trouble for others.

### The Bull(公牛), then Lioness, and the Hunter

A bull, finding a lion's baby son asleep, killed the baby with his horns(角).

The lioness came up, and bitterly wept(哭泣）over the death of her son.

A hunter, seeing her weep(哭泣), stood at a distance and said to her,

> "How many children have you killed yourself?"

MORAL: We think about how others hurt us, but we don't think about how we hurt them.
