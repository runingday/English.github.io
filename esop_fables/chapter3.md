### 熟词生义
1. sign
【本文例句】
+ Evil signs are shown early in life. 邪恶的迹象在很小的时候就显现出来了.

本文中, sign作名词，表"迹象、征兆", sign的另一个常见名词意思为”符号、标志“, 常见动词意思为"签字".

【点睛例句】
+ Sign here. 在这里签名.
+ There's no sign of life on Mars. 火星上没生命迹象。
+ /:lvu is the sign language for "I love you".
这是表"我爱你”的手势语言

2 young
【本文例句】
+ The bird said to her young, "It is time to go."
这只鸟跟自己的孩子说："到时间该走了“。

大家可能听过【the + 形容词】 表一类人的用法。
本文中，her young 就是相似用法，表”幼崽、幼兽、幼鸟",英文释义为the babies of an animal. the young可表"年轻人们".
### * * * *

3. neck
【本文例句】
+ The neck of the jar wasn't wide enough. 瓶颈开口不够大。
nect 做名词表身体部位时，意思是”脖子“; 引申描述物件时，表”颈状部位、细长部分“。 明白了这样的拟人表达，那么cap表”笔帽、瓶盖“、foot表”床脚、山脚“就顺理成章了。

【点睛例句】
+ the foot of the mountain 山脚
+ Put the cap back on the pen 给笔盖上笔帽. 

### 短语句型

1 help sb with sth 帮某人（做）某事
【本文例句】
+ I must ask all my neighbors to help me with my harvest. 我必须让所有邻居都来帮我收割.
当想表达”帮某人做某事“的时候，很难想到"help sb with sth”，因为这个短语中并没有表"做“的动作词. 
看两个例子吧：
+ My husband always helps me in doing housework.
+ My husband always helps me with housework.
有没有感觉到，第二个例句更为简洁呢？试着用用help sb with sth这个短语吧 ~~~

+ 我的父母帮我负担学费(tuition fee).
My parents help me with the tuition fee.

2 be satisfied with 对...满意
【本文例句】
+ Be satisfied with half the amount, and you will easily pull out your hand. 如果满意只抓一半的量，那么手很容易拿得出来.

【亮点】
satisfied 加上程序词，可以表达到底有多满意。
特别满意 more than satisfied （比满意还满意的感觉）
不太满意 far from satisfied （距离满意还有段距离呢）

【点睛例句】
+ I'm sure that you'll be more than satisfied with our product. 我敢肯定你会非常满意我们的产品。
+ I'm far from satisfied with his explanation. 我对他的解释远达不到满意的程序。

3 It's good to do sth 做某事是很好的
【本文例句】
+ sometimes it's good to be unimportant. 有时微不足道也是一种优势。

【亮点】
It's good to do sth, 表"做某事是很好的”。 其中，it没有意思，是英语中的形式主语;变换一下可以说To do sth is good. good的位置，可替换各种形容词，形成不同句型结构:
+ It's easy to learn English. 学英语很容易.
+ It's exciting to be part of the team. 成为团队一员让人激动.
