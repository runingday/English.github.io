# <center> The Big and The Little Fish </center>
As a fisherman was pulling in his net from the sea, he noticed that it was full of all sorts of (各种各样的)fish.

The little fish got away through the holes in the net and swam to safety, while the big fish could not get away and were caught.

MORAL: Sometimes it's good to be unimportant.

# <center> The Bird and Her Babies </center>

A bird had made her nest in a farmer's field, and her babies were almost grown.

> The owner of the field came and said, "I must ask all my neighbors to help me with my harvest."

One of the young birds heard him, and asked his mother where they should move for safety.

> "We don't need to move yet, my son," she replied.

> The owner came a few days later, and said, "I will come by myself tomorrow, and start the harvest."

> Then the bird said to her young, "It is time to go. His friends aren't coming. He will do the work himself."

MORAL: If you need something done properly, do it yourself.
